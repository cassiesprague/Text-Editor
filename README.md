# Text Editor

## Description
This application allows users to create notes without needing internet conncetion. It uses PWA to maintain a single page text editor that runs in the browser. 

My motivation for this application was to have a way to keep notes and not need internet. This also runs with internet, but does not need it to function. In an ever chaning world, people need to take notes constantly and if there is no internet, there needs to still be a way to keep that information.
